            A jungle may be land or area with a particularly 
            dense quantity of vegetation. This dense forest 
            of vegetation includes several trees and plants 
            found in tropical climates. They're also home to 
            high biodiversity and many unique species but are 
            also some of the most fragile ecosystems on Earth.
